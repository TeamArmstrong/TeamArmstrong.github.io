# Welcome to Team Armstrong

Our team is called the Armstrong. Like our name, our members come from a strong background of software development experience accumulated from a range of successful personal and academic projects, as well as co-op work experience in active agile enviroments. 

### Team Goals:
* As a team, we are excited to combine our skillsets and proudly contribute quality code to the amazing [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) project.
* Learn about the process of developing/maintaining an open source project, as well as understand the difference between developing a plugin/standalone app and contribute to an existing project
* Challenge ourselves to learn something new and have fun while doing it!

### Team Strength:
* Industry experience: Four out of five team members have worked in the industry before, which has allowed us to learn about managing projects, the SDLC, and best development/coding practices. We can use these things to our advantage during matplotlib development.
* We all have strong technical skills: With or without industry experience, we’re all technically proficient and are willing to learn about as many technologies/tools as we can in order to succeed.
* We’re quick learners
* We are all very motivated and want our team to succeed as a whole.

I am a 3rd year Computer Science Specialist student at the University of Toronto with a passion in software and web design. Through my dedication in my studies, I have established high proficiency in developing, testing, and debugging software in various programming languages including Python, Java, and C. I have experience with test-driven and object-oriented development, as well as many development strategies and testing methodologies through course and personal projects. My two years of co-op work experience has given me deep exposure and familiarity with Agile environments, and real word practice in quality assurance testing and development work, particularly in Powershell, SQL, and C#. I love learning new things, and enjoy investing my time to expand my knowledge and expertise in any way. I find myself frequently on Youtube watching different videos and tutorials, picking up new skills and knowledge. In that respect, I also like to travel and spend time with friends and family.

Alix is a fourth year Computer Science student in the Comprehensive stream at the University of Toronto Scarborough. She has had two co-op work terms at Leonardo Inc, where she learned about various Agile (Scrum) development practices, including the importance and responsibilities of different roles in a Scrum team and utilizing JIRA, Confluence and Jenkins for Agile (Scrum) Development. As a part of the DevOps team, Alix structured a UAT automation framework for website testing where she demonstrated strong programming skills and improved developers' local working environment while using PuppetLab and Vagrant.
As a student at UTSC, Alix is an overachiever and  a fast-learner. She is familiar with `*`nix environment and picks up programming languages quickly. As a TA at UTSC, she is patient with her students and loves to offer help whenever wanted. When Alix is not working, she is a makeup artist, movie-lover and short-distant runner.

I am a fourth year student in Computer Science in the Software Engineering Specialist at the University of Toronto Scarborough. I have been stuck with technology since elementary school and began to learn programming since sixth grade. After years of self-learning and experience I have became proficient in C, C++, Java, and Python. After learning Python in my first year of university it has quickly became my favourite language. I have done two co-op work terms, one at the Royal Bank of Canada and the other at the Ministry at Education and I have learned to use many testing tools, SDLC, Agile, Java EE development and other skills that otherwise would not be taught fully in university. During my free time, I enjoying reading tech articles, acquiring knowledge from a variety of fields on the internet, and searching for the best technological and travel deals for myself and my friends.
