### Melissa Tam
I am a 3rd year Computer Science Specialist student at the University of Toronto with a passion in software and web design. Through my dedication in my studies, I have established high proficiency in developing, testing, and debugging software in various programming languages including Python, Java, and C. I have experience with test-driven and object-oriented development, as well as many development strategies and testing methodologies through course and personal projects. My two years of co-op work experience has given me deep exposure and familiarity with Agile environments, and real word practice in quality assurance testing and development work, particularly in Powershell, SQL, and C#. I love learning new things, and enjoy investing my time to expand my knowledge and expertise in any way. I find myself frequently on Youtube watching different videos and tutorials, picking up new skills and knowledge. In that respect, I also like to travel and spend time with friends and family.
