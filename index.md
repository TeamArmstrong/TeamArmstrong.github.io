# Welcome to Team Armstrong

<img src="https://github.com/TeamArmstrong/teamarmstrong.github.io/raw/master/images/team.JPG" alt="team"/>

Our team is called the Armstrong. Like our name, our members come from a strong background of software development experience accumulated from a range of successful personal and academic projects, as well as co-op work experience in active agile enviroments. 

### Team Goals:
* As a team, we are excited to combine our skillsets and proudly contribute quality code to the amazing [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) project.
* Learn about the process of developing/maintaining an open source project, as well as understanding the difference between developing a plugin and a standalone app and contributing to an existing project.
* Challenge ourselves to learn something new and have fun while doing it!

### Team Strength:
* Industry experience: Four out of five team members have worked in the industry before, which has allowed us to learn about managing projects, the SDLC, and best development/coding practices. We can use these things to our advantage when developing new features to the matplotlib project.
* We all have strong technical skills: With or without industry experience, we’re all technically proficient and willing to learn about any technology and tool to succeed.
* We are quick learners
* We are all very motivated and want our team to succeed as a whole.

I am a 3rd year Computer Science Specialist student at the University of Toronto with a passion in software and web design. Through my dedication in my studies, I have established high proficiency in developing, testing, and debugging software in various programming languages including Python, Java, and C. I have experience with test-driven and object-oriented development, as well as many development strategies and testing methodologies through course and personal projects. My two years of co-op work experience has given me deep exposure and familiarity with Agile environments, and real word practice in quality assurance testing and development work, particularly in Powershell, SQL, and C#. I love learning new things, and enjoy investing my time to expand my knowledge and expertise in any way. I find myself frequently on Youtube watching different videos and tutorials, picking up new skills and knowledge. In that respect, I also like to travel and spend time with friends and family.

### Alix Lian

I am a fourth year Computer Science student in the Comprehensive Stream at the University of Toronto Scarborough. I had two co-op work terms at Leonardo Inc, where I learned about various Agile (Scrum) development practices, including the importance and responsibilities of different roles in a Scrum team and utilizing JIRA, Confluence and Jenkins for Agile (Scrum) Development. As a part of the DevOps team, I structured a UAT automation framework for website testing where I demonstrated strong programming skills and improved developers' local working environment while using PuppetLab and Vagrant.
As a student at UTSC, I am an overachiever and  a fast-learner. I am familiar with *nix environment and pick up programming languages quickly. As a TA at UTSC, I am patient with my students and love to offer help whenever wanted. When I am not working, I am a makeup artist, movie-lover and short-distant runner.

### Ray Chu

I am a fourth year student in Computer Science in the Software Engineering Specialist at the University of Toronto Scarborough. I have been interested with technology since elementary school and began to learn programming since sixth grade. After years of self-learning and experience I have became proficient in C, C++, Java, and Python. After learning Python in my first year of university it has quickly became my favourite language. I have done two co-op work terms, one at the Royal Bank of Canada and the other at the Ministry at Education and I have learned to use many testing tools, the SDLC, Agile, Java EE development and other skills that otherwise would not be taught fully in university. During my free time, I enjoying reading tech articles, acquiring knowledge from a variety of fields through the internet, and searching for the best technological and travel deals for myself and my friends.

### Steven Xia
<img src="https://github.com/TeamArmstrong/teamarmstrong.github.io/raw/master/images/Steven.png" alt="Steven" style="float:right; width: 300px;  padding-left: 20px;"/>
I am Steven Xia, a fourth year student in the Software Engineering Specialist program at the University of Toronto Scarborough. As soon as I entered the university, I realized my passion for Computer Science. Driven by this passion, I have done some personal and team projects involving web service, computer graphics and AI, and have become proficient in programming languages such as Python, C, C++, C# and Java. I have one-year co-op experience in development, testing and benchmarking the backend of a web-based collaboration environment using SQL Server and C#. These experiences helped me gain an in-depth understanding of software development, software design and computer architecture. In my spare time, I like experimenting with technologies in computer graphics and procedural generation, programming with languages including Go, GLSL, Haskell, and trying out software such as Blender, Photoshop and Unity3D. I also enjoy watching anime, listening to music and playing various video games.

### Sam Wong

I am a third year student in UTSC where I major in Computer Science. C# is my first programming language and over the years I have learned Python, Java, php, C, HTML and SQL. I have built several small projects on my own with jQuery and Javascript. I am familiar with JSON Server construction and fully experienced in Android application development. I am familiar with *nix and windows envioronment. Programming within diverse environments makes me an experienced programmer. I also developed strong skills such as teamwork, problem-solving and communication, which enhanced my capacity to face varied challenges under any circumstances. I enjoy music and sports, and also like learning about new technology (such as mobile software and hardware) through online research and books, and making use of them in daily life. Also, I am very interested in the development of Bitcoin, self-driving cars and VR.
